*********************Readme File for the English Input Files********************This archive contains the input files for the English past tense simulations using the Albright and Hayes Rule-based Learner, as described in "Rules vs. Analogy in English Past Tenses: A Computational/Experimental Study" (http://www.linguistics.ucla.edu/people/hayes/RulesVsAnalogy/index.htm)These files were created on a mac; it is possible that you may need to convert the line endings in order to edit them on a PC or in unix!(The learner program itself can use text files of any format, since java is designed to handle all three text file formats; Microsoft Excel can also open both Mac and DOS text files.  Command-line perl is pickier, though, so if you wanted to use the perl script in windows or unix, you may need to convert the file to the relevant text format)It contains two input files: one with the entire set of verbs with a lemma frequency of 10 or greater in CELEX, and one in which "prefixed verbs" have been removed.The definition of "prefixed verb" was: the root must be a free verb stem (i.e., occurs in isolation without the prefix), and prefix must be acting identifiably as the prefix (i.e., its meaning is somehow contained in the complex verb, even if the entire verb is not transparent).  For example, "react" contains the free stem "act", and the meaning of "react" was judged to contain the meaning of "re-", so this was treated as a prefixed form and removed.The .in files are the input files, the .fea files contain the feature matrix which we employed for English.Thus, there are four files:CELEXFull.feaCELEXFull.inCELEXPrefixStrip.inCELEXPrefixStrip.feaThere is also a batch file (CELEXFitAlphasAll.bat), which can be run using the "Open Batch File" option in the File menu of the Learner program; this is designed to run, in serial, a variety of parameter settings for confidence values, for purposes for fitting to experimental data.Finally, there is a perl script for collecting the predictions of the rule-based learner for the specific novel verbs which were considered in the "Rules vs. Analogy" paper; this is probably of limited usefulness by itself, but could be modified to collect ratings for other verbs and outputs for other studies:  GetLearnerPreds.pl********************************************************************************Created 10/17/01 by Adam AlbrightFor additional questions and information, contact me: aalbrigh@ucla.edu
